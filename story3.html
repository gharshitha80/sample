<h2>The Triumph of Aslan</h2>
 <div> <p>Mr. and Mrs. Beaver and the three children arrive at Aslan's camp, atop a hill on which the Stone Table rests, "a great grim slab of gray stone supported on four upright
    <br>stones." Crowds of animals, tree-women and well-women (dryads and naiads), centaurs, and others have rallied in support, and Aslan receives the children, who are awed 
    <br>by his fearsome, magnificent presence. As the great lion shows Peter the castle Cair Paravel in the distance, "where you are to be King," a strange noise cuts through 
    <br>the calm. It is the horn given to Susan by Father Christmas to summon help in times of crisis. Peter races to his sister, who is stranded up a tree with Maugrim's teeth 
    <br>snapping at her heels. One thrust of Peter's sword fells the beast. As another wolf escapes into the forest, Aslan dispatches a party of warriors to hunt them down, for
    <br>surely they will be returning to their mistress. "Now is your chance to find the Witch and rescue the fourth Son of Adam," Aslan cries. Then Aslan knights Peter as Sir
    <br>Peter Wolf's-Bane, for his valor, and tells him to never forget to clean his sword.
     <p> Back in the forest, the witch and the dwarf grimly speculate that the children must have already reached the Stone Table by now. The witch decides to thwart the prophecy 
    <br>of the four thrones by killing Edmund on the spot, even though the Stone Table "is the proper place. That is where it has always been done before," she says. Just then,
    <br>the wolf who escaped Aslan's encampment rushes in and warns the witch of the approaching army, but she refuses to flee. She charges the wolf to gather her own forces
       <br>together to stand and fight.. The dwarf ties Edmund, who is too exhausted to even struggle, to a tree, and the witch readies her stone knife to cut his throat. Suddenly,
       <br>a horde of creatures thunders onto the scene and cuts Edmund's bonds—it is the rescue party sent by Aslan. The witch and the dwarf disappear in the confusion, and Edmund 
       <br>is brought safely to camp. After a long, somber conversation with Aslan, Edmund humbly makes peace with his siblings, who are relieved their brother is safe at last.
  </p>
  <p>The dwarf then arrives and requests an audience with Aslan for the White Witch. He agrees, and the witch emerges from the woods, unarmed. She calls out Edmund as a traitor 
    <br>and claims the right to kill him—a right ensured to her by the Deep Magic that was woven into the world since the dawn of time. Aslan draws her aside in private 
    <br>conversation, where they make a secret agreement. The crowd rejoices when the witch relinquishes her claim on Edmund, "a look of fierce joy on her face." But Aslan has 
    <br>made her a promise, and she strides away in triumph.
    <p>That same day, Aslan walks Peter through strategies for the upcoming battle, stating that he himself can't promise to be on hand for the fight. The lion's mood is somber 
      <br>throughout the day, and later that night, Susan and Lucy see him stealing away from camp. When they follow him through the woods, he senses their presence and allows
      <br>them to continue onward with him, for "I should be glad of company tonight." As they approach the hill where the Stone Table sits, Aslan leaves the girls behind, 
      <br>cautioning them that "whatever happens, do not let yourselves be seen." He bids farewell, and the girls weep without knowing exactly why. Awaiting Aslan on the hill
      <br>is the witch and her throng of evil creatures, who tie Aslan to the Stone Table and torment him cruelly. Aslan offers no resistance while they hurt and humiliate him, 
      <br>and the witch gloats that he has made Narnia hers forever. "You have lost your own life and you have not saved his," she sneers just before she plunges her knife into 
      <br>Aslan's body, killing him.
      <p>The gleeful horde of ghouls and creatures departs to hunt down Aslan's army, leaving Lucy and Susan to weep over his body. Little do they know, however, that there
        <br>is an even Deeper Magic in action from before the dawn of time. As dawn brightens the sky, the Stone Table cracks in two and Aslan reappears, whole and heartier than
        <br>ever. The lion has overcome Death by freely offering himself, "a willing victim who had committed no treachery" in place of the traitor Edmund. Joyful, the three 
        <br>share a wondrous ride through the forest, with Susan and Lucy clinging to Aslan's back. Their first stop is the witch's castle, where Aslan restores the stone 
        <br>statues into living creatures by breathing the breath of life into them. This new army made from the woken creatures hastens toward the scene of the battle, where 
        <br>the rest of Aslan's army is fighting, arriving just as all hope seems lost. With fresh reinforcements, the witch's evil army is quickly routed, and Aslan kills the 
        <br>White Witch in the thick of battle.
  </p>
  <p>Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy take their rightful places as kings and queens of Narnia, and they justly reign for many peaceful years. As time passes, the children grow 
    <br>into adults, forgetting their former lives in England. Yet one day, they embark on a hunt for the fabled White Stag, a creature said to grant wishes to whoever can
    <br>capture it. The stag leads them back to the lamppost, where memories of their old world begin to return. They stumble out through the wardrobe door and find they are
    <br>children once again. No time has passed in their own world. They confess all to the Professor, who assures them that someday they will return to Narnia.
    <br>For after all, he says, "Once a King in Narnia, always a King in Narnia.
