<h1>The Chronicles of Narnia  | The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</h1>
<h2> Narnia Discovered </h2>
<p>As World War II unfolds, four siblings are sent to the safety of the countryside to escape the air raids of London.Peter
<br>Pevensie, Susan Pevensie, Edmund Pevensie, and Lucy Pevensie arrive at the grand manor of Professor Digory Kirke. As they
<br> explore the house, Lucy, the youngest, steps into a massive wardrobe tucked away in a spare room. Inside the wardrobe, she
<br> discovers the magical realm of Narnia, a wintery land of talking animals, tree spirits, and other fantastical creatures. She soon
<br> meets Tumnus, a faun, standing near a glowing lamppost in the middle of the forest. He invites her for tea and lulls her to sleep
<br> with his mystical flute. Unknown to Lucy, he plans to turn her over to the White Witch, who is ever watchful for trespassing
<br> humansâ€”Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve. Lucy charms Tumnus, however, and his conscience gets the better of him. He 
<br>hustles her back to the safety of her own world before the witch can capture her. Lucy emerges from the wardrobe, excited to
<br> share her adventure with her siblings, but they find her tale too far-fetched to believe, since literally no time has passed, and
<br>honest Lucy is devastated.
