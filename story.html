<h1>The Chronicles of Narnia  | The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</h1>
<h2> Narnia Discovered </h2>
  <img src="">
<p>  As World War II unfolds, four siblings are sent to the safety of the countryside to escape the air raids of London.Peter
<br>Pevensie, Susan Pevensie, Edmund Pevensie, and Lucy Pevensie arrive at the grand manor of Professor Digory Kirke. As they
<br> explore the house, Lucy, the youngest, steps into a massive wardrobe tucked away in a spare room. Inside the wardrobe, she
<br> discovers the magical realm of Narnia, a wintery land of talking animals, tree spirits, and other fantastical creatures. She soon
<br> meets Tumnus, a faun, standing near a glowing lamppost in the middle of the forest. He invites her for tea and lulls her to sleep
<br> with his mystical flute. Unknown to Lucy, he plans to turn her over to the White Witch, who is ever watchful for trespassing
<br> humans—Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve. Lucy charms Tumnus, however, and his conscience gets the better of him. He 
<br>hustles her back to the safety of her own world before the witch can capture her. Lucy emerges from the wardrobe, excited to
<br> share her adventure with her siblings, but they find her tale too far-fetched to believe, since literally no time has passed, and
<br>honest Lucy is devastated.
  </p>
<p>   Some days later, Lucy reenters the wardrobe to visit Tumnus, and this time Edmund sneaks in behind her. Once inside,
 <br> he is astonished to discover that Lucy was telling the truth about Narnia.
 <br> Before he can find her to apologize, however, a grand sleigh arrives, pulled by reindeer and driven by a dwarf. 
  <br>Its passenger calls herself the Queen of Narnia. Upon discovering a human boy in her realm, the queen beguiles Edmund with soft-spoken lies, flattery, 
  <br>and enchanted confections. As Edmund gorges on bewitched Turkish delight, he thoughtlessly divulges 
 <br> information about his siblings, as well as Lucy's association with the Faun Tumnus.
  <br>The queen promises to make Edmund King of Narnia one day, but only if he will return to Narnia with his three siblings and bring them to her. She points out the 
  <br>direction of her home so that Edmund can find her when he returns, and then drives away.
</p>
  <p>Lucy arrives moments after the Queen's departure, thrilled to see her brother, who now can corroborate her story with their skeptical siblings. 
    <br>. She warns him about the White Witch, who is hated across the land by all good creatures and who has cast a spell over Narnia so that it is "always winter, 
    <br>but it never gets to be Christmas." Edmund realizes Lucy is describing the woman he just encountered,the so-called Queen of Narnia. Still longing for more of
    <br> the bewitched candy, however, he dismisses her warning, declaring peevishly, "You can't always believe what Fauns say."
    <br>As they return to their own world through the wardrobe, Edmund stews over having to admit Lucy was right to his siblings, who will surely "all be on the 
    <br>side of the Fauns and the animals," while he himself is "already more than half on the side of the Witch."
  </p>
  <p>Once back home, Edmund pettily denies the visit to Narnia ever happened, leaving Lucy in tears.
    <br>Peter angrily accuses him of toying with young Lucy "out of spite," and Peter and Susan begin to worry that Lucy has truly lost her mind.
    <br>Desperate for advice, they confess all to the Professor Digory Kirke, who, much to their surprise, takes Lucy's side. "How do you know?"
    <br>he asks, "that your sister's story is not true?" She is clearly not mad, he states, nor does she have a history of telling lies (unlike Edmund),
    <br>and therefore she must be telling the truth. Unable to come to a logical conclusion they can accept, the children let the matter drop.
  </p>
  <h2>Trouble Brewing in Narnia </h2>
  <p>One morning not long thereafter, the children are forced to hide in the wardrobe in order to avoid the stern housekeeper Mrs. Macready
    <br>and a party of visitors who are touring the mansion. They find themselves in Narnia, where a slip of the tongue by Edmund reveals
    <br>that he has, in fact, visited Narnia before. Disgusted, Peter calls him out as a liar and likens him to some "poisonous little beasts," 
    <br>and Edmund secretly vows to pay back his "stuck-up, self-satisfied" siblings.
  </p>
  <p>The  four set off through the snow for Tumnus's home, only to find it ransacked and the faun arrested for treason against the White Witch.
    <br>Feeling responsible, Lucy insists they try to rescue Tumnus, and the others reluctantly agree. With no leads on where to begin, the children
    <br>follow a clever-looking robin into the forest, where they encounter Mr. Beaver, who spirits them away to his dam on a frozen river. Once 
    <br>safely inside, Mr. Beaver discloses that Tumnus has been taken to the White Witch's house, lamenting that few who enter her home ever come 
    <br>out again. Mrs. Beaver prepares a hot meal for the cold, famished crew, and after dinner, Mr. Beaver tells of Aslan the Lion, "the Lord 
    <br>of the whole wood," who has returned to Narnia after a long absence. "He'll put all to rights," Mr. Beaver assures them, revealing key
    <br>prophecies to the children: Winter will end when Aslan returns, and the evil Queen's reign will topple "when Adam's flesh and Adam's
    <br>bone / Sits at Cair Paravel in throne."  The four thrones of castle Cair Paravel await the arrival of two Sons of Adam and two Daughters 
    <br>of Eve—and surely, these must be Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. Mr. Beaver says the children are to meet Aslan at the Stone Table as 
    <br>soon as possible, and Aslan will help them rescue Tumnus. Somewhere in the midst of these revelations, Edmund slips away into the whirling 
    <br>snowstorm outside. Mr. Beaver knows instantly that "[h]e's gone to her, to the White Witch. He has betrayed us all."
  </p>
    <p>Meanwhile, Edmund arrives at the witch's house, where he encounters an eerie courtyard of lifelike statues—noble creatures
      <br>the witch has turned to stone with her magic wand. He is escorted to the witch by a talking wolf, Maugrim, the Chief
      <br>of the Secret Police. The witch is enraged that Edmund has come without his siblings, and Edmund spills his guts about his
      <br>siblings, Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, and their plans to rendezvous with Aslan at the Stone Table.
