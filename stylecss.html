Harry Potter was first introduced in the novel Harry Potter and the
<br> Philosopher’s Stone (1997; also published as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone),
<br> as an orphan who is mistreated by his guardian aunt and uncle and their son.
<br> On his 11th birthday Harry discovers that his parents were a witch and a
<br> wizard and that he, a wizard himself, has been invited to attend Hogwarts
<br> School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He also learns that his parents had not
<br> perished in a car accident, as his aunt and uncle had told him, but that they
<br> instead had been murdered by an evil wizard named Voldemort. Harry was the
<br> only person to have ever survived an attack by Voldemort—by somehow 
<br>rebounding the latter’s “killing curse”—which left him with a lightning-bolt-
<br>shaped scar on his forehead. Indeed, Harry’s mysterious survival had all but
<br> killed Voldemort, who was left disembodied, and the young boy was thus
<br> already a celebrated figure in the “wizarding” community. At Hogwarts Harry becomes
<br>fast friends with classmates Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger and
                                                                                                                                                   <br> finds a rival in Draco Malfoy.</p>

<p> He is taken under the wing of the school’s
<br>headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. These relationships persist throughout the
<br> series, especially as the young wizards and witches grow older and are called
<br> upon to take sides in a growing wizard war.
<br>Unbeknownst to Harry, and to much of the wizarding world in general,
<br> Voldemort is planning a return to power. Although at first feeble and living as a
<br>parasite in a follower’s body, Voldemort makes attempts on Harry’s life 
<br>beginning in the first book and continuing throughout the series. In the fourth volume,
<br> Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2000), Voldemort regains his
<br> body and former strength through a magic ritual, and thereafter his army greatly
<br> increases in number.
