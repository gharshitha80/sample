<h2> The Tide Turns</h2>
 <div> <p>Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, Peter, Susan, and Lucy quickly gather supplies and flee the cozy dam, fearing the arrival of the police at any moment. They set out to find Aslan
    <br>in a race against the White Witch to the Stone Table, where the lordly lion awaits. In the dark of night, they take refuge in a hidden cave and sink into exhausted 
    <br>sleep. They awaken to the sound of jingling bells and are delighted to find Father Christmas has arrived. He gives the children weapons for the upcoming battle, and
    <br>to Lucy, he gives a precious bottle of cordial that heals all wounds. Cheered by the advent of Christmas—a clear sign the witch's power is waning—the party once again 
    <br>embarks to find Aslan.
  </p>
  <p>Edmund, on the other hand, has "been having a most disappointing time" at the witch's home, where he is treated with contempt and given nothing but stale, dry bread
    <br>to eat. The witch sends Maugrim to gather his pack of wolves and raid the Beavers' dam, though they arrive to an empty house. The witch, the dwarf, and Edmund, who now 
    <br>is clearly a prisoner, race in the sleigh through the snowy night toward the Stone Table. As morning breaks, they come upon a merry party of animals feasting on plum 
    <br>pudding, a gift from Father Christmas. Infuriated, the witch raises her wand to blast the poor creatures. Edmund pleads with the witch but cannot stop her from turning 
    <br>them to stone, after which she strikes him viciously. "For the first time in this story," Edmund feels sympathy "for someone besides himself." They continue, but as 
    <br>winter loses its hold on the land, the snow begins to melt and the sleigh can go no farther. Edmund's hands are tied behind his back, and he is force-marched forward 
    <br>as spring blooms about them.
