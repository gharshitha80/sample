 <h2>Trouble Brewing in Narnia </h2>
  <div><p>One morning not long thereafter, the children are forced to hide in the wardrobe in order to avoid the stern housekeeper Mrs. Macready
    <br>and a party of visitors who are touring the mansion. They find themselves in Narnia, where a slip of the tongue by Edmund reveals
    <br>that he has, in fact, visited Narnia before. Disgusted, Peter calls him out as a liar and likens him to some "poisonous little beasts," 
    <br>and Edmund secretly vows to pay back his "stuck-up, self-satisfied" siblings.

  </p>
  <p>The  four set off through the snow for Tumnus's home, only to find it ransacked and the faun arrested for treason against the White Witch.
    <br>Feeling responsible, Lucy insists they try to rescue Tumnus, and the others reluctantly agree. With no leads on where to begin, the children
    <br>follow a clever-looking robin into the forest, where they encounter Mr. Beaver, who spirits them away to his dam on a frozen river. Once 
    <br>safely inside, Mr. Beaver discloses that Tumnus has been taken to the White Witch's house, lamenting that few who enter her home ever come 
    <br>out again. Mrs. Beaver prepares a hot meal for the cold, famished crew, and after dinner, Mr. Beaver tells of Aslan the Lion, "the Lord 
    <br>of the whole wood," who has returned to Narnia after a long absence. "He'll put all to rights," Mr. Beaver assures them, revealing key
    <br>prophecies to the children: Winter will end when Aslan returns, and the evil Queen's reign will topple "when Adam's flesh and Adam's
    <br>bone / Sits at Cair Paravel in throne."  The four thrones of castle Cair Paravel await the arrival of two Sons of Adam and two Daughters 
    <br>of Eve—and surely, these must be Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. Mr. Beaver says the children are to meet Aslan at the Stone Table as 
    <br>soon as possible, and Aslan will help them rescue Tumnus. Somewhere in the midst of these revelations, Edmund slips away into the whirling 
    <br>snowstorm outside. Mr. Beaver knows instantly that "[h]e's gone to her, to the White Witch. He has betrayed us all."
  </p>
    <p>Meanwhile, Edmund arrives at the witch's house, where he encounters an eerie courtyard of lifelike statues—noble creatures
      <br>the witch has turned to stone with her magic wand. He is escorted to the witch by a talking wolf, Maugrim, the Chief
      <br>of the Secret Police. The witch is enraged that Edmund has come without his siblings, and Edmund spills his guts about his
      <br>siblings, Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, and their plans to rendezvous with Aslan at the Stone Table.
